## Who are we

Lookup was designed and developed by Sam Gregory so that people could spend more time looking at their phones than actualy discovering the world around them for themselves.

## The code

Lookup was built using static-site templating language Handlebars, SASS, and ES2015. Interacting with the Foursquare API using AJAX to retrieve the most popular places in a given location, plus the users current location. With the help of Bootstrap-sass so that i was able to quickly put together a mobile-first website and adjust styles where necessary. 

I used task-runner Grunt to assemble and build the code.
